=============================

Javascript Single Page App. Code challenge for GeneralAssembly.

I wrote this app using yeoman and the angular generator. This was mostly to demonstrate use of an advanced tool. However I mainly stuck to simple JS and jquery for the application code itself.

+ Make sure to have an updated npm: `npm update -g npm`
+ cd into the top directory, and run `grunt serve`.
+ That should be it!
