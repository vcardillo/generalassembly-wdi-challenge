generalassembly-wdi-challenge
=============================

Javascript Single Page App. Code challenge for GeneralAssembly.

I wrote this app using Yeoman and the Angular generator. This was mostly to demonstrate use of an advanced tool. However, I mainly stuck to simple JS and jquery for the application code itself.

To view the project:

+ Make sure to have an updated npm: `npm update -g npm` (built on npm 2.1.5)
+ Install yeoman: `npm install -g yo`
+ Install generator-angular: `npm install -g generator-angular`
+ cd into the top directory, and run `grunt serve`.
+ That should be it!

If you have any problems using `grunt` to serve the project, please let me know and I will compile a static build for you.
